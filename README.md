# Amazon Sales Data Analysis
## This project analyzes sales data from Amazon's three branches in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The aim is to uncover insights about product performance, sales trends, and customer behavior to guide business strategies.

## Project Overview
### Data: The dataset contains 17 columns, including details about each transaction (invoice, branch, customer, product, and sales).
### Analysis: The project explores product line performance, monthly sales trends, customer segment behavior, and more.
### Key Questions: What is the highest performing product line? Which customer type generates the most revenue? Which month has the highest sales?

## Approach
### Data Wrangling: Cleaned data, handled missing values, and ensured consistency.
### Feature Engineering:
### Added columns: timeofday, dayname, and monthname for deeper insights.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends in product sales, customer behavior, and branch performance.

## Formulas
### Total Sales: Total Sales = Quantity * Unit Price
### Gross Margin: (Total Sales - Cost of Goods Sold) / Total Sales * 100
### Average Rating: Average Rating = SUM(Rating) / COUNT(Transactions)
### Monthly Revenue: SUM(Total Sales) (grouped by month)
### Customer Segment Contribution: SUM(Total Sales) (grouped by customer type)
